+ does it really **matter**?
+ nothing i do will **change** whether it happens
+ probably won't even happen in my **lifetime**
+ I'm a Chr so I'm good: wait for my **reward**

  + what is **coming**
  + who we **are** in Christ
  + what we should be **doing**
  + in preparation for His return
+ Behold the **Lamb**: (prayer)

(prayer)
>>>
+ Risen Saviour: by Your undeserved **grace**
  + we've received your new **life**

+ Shake us from our **sleep** + **drunkenness**
+ stand firm in **faith**, love, hope
  + until day you return

+ **Reality** of Chr's return:
  + inescapable, must reckon
+ **Identity** as sons of day
  + even though might not feel so
+ **Responsibility** to engage in 
  + Chr's work, 
  + equipped w/**armor** of God
+ The **teaching** starts back in ch4,
  + perhaps responding to Q about
  + believers who have **died**:

---
But we do not want you to be uninformed, <br>
brothers, about those who are asleep, <br>
that you may not grieve <br>
as others do who have no hope.

[1 Thesssalonians 4:13 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ "asleep": not annihil, not **ghosts** / angel
  + not look from heaven **guiding** us
+ but waiting in hope for Chr's **return**: v16

---
For the Lord himself will descend  <br>
from heaven with a cry of command,  <br>
with the voice of an archangel,  <br>
and with the sound of the trumpet of God.

And the dead in Christ will rise first.   <br>
[17](# "ref")
Then we who are alive, who are left,  <br>
will be caught up together with them  <br>
in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air,  <br>
and so we will always be with the Lord.

[1 Thesssalonians 4:16-17 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ seems **unbelievable** bc far out of daily exp
+ but so was creation, flood, **resurr**
+ this is **real**, coming, imminent
  + might be those **asleep**, or still alive
+ **When** will this happen?
  + **Chronology** (num of years)
  + or **seq** of events

---
For you yourselves are fully aware  <br>
that the day of the Lord will come  <br>
like a thief in the night. 

[1 Thesssalonians 5:2 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **futile** to predict precise time/seq
+ Thief not at time of your **choosing**
+ World sees slow **continuity** of history
  + and assumes Chr will **never** return:
  + 2 Pet 3:

---
They will say, “Where is the promise of his coming? <br>
For ever since the fathers fell asleep, <br>
all things are continuing as they were <br>
from the beginning of creation.”

[2 Peter 3:4 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Testimony of **creation** + **flood**
+ Cosmos of the **now** treasured up
  + for judgement by **fire**: v3

---
While people are saying,  <br>
“There is peace and security,”  <br>
then sudden destruction will come upon them  <br>
as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman,  <br>
and they will not escape.

[1 Thesssalonians 5:3 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ not that having **baby** is **destruc**
  + though a **lot** of blood!
+ "labor pains": sudden, severe, inescapable:
  + can't **wish** the pain away
  + only way out is **through** it
+ Day of Lord is imminent **reality**:
  + it is **going** to happen
+ w/**trumpet** blast, **all** flesh will see
  + God's **glory** + authority

>>>
+ **fantasy** / fiction

>>>
+ To those who **ignore** the reality
  + of Chr's imminent return:
  + sudden, inescapable **destruction**
+ But take **heart**: you are not that way
+ Series of three **contrasts**:
  + not in darkness, but of **light**
  + not sleeping, but **awake**
  + not drunken, but **sober**

---
But you are not in darkness, brothers,  <br>
for that day to surprise you like a thief:  <br>
[5](# "ref")
For you are all children of light,  <br>
children of the day. 

[1 Thesssalonians 5:4-5a (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ sons of light + sons of day
+ don't **feel** like sons of day:
  + **impostor** syndrome
  + always-on, happy, holy
+ not **gen** light of self, but
  + **inherit** from Father of lights
+ not that we're **righteous**, but **forgiven**
+ skipping ahead to v9:

---
For God has not destined us for wrath,  <br>
but to obtain salvation through <br>
our Lord Jesus Christ

[1 Thesssalonians 5:9 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ God **set** us on this **path**:
+ not heading to **condemnation** / wrath
  + but to attain of **rescue** / redemp
+ **Remember** what Chr has **done**
  + and who we **are** in Christ
+ **Forgiven**, on path to salvation, 
  + children of **light**

# Do I sometimes <br> feel like an **impostor**?
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

>>>
+ Others look to me to be **stable**, 
  + wise, kind, bring **light**
+ But I wrestle with **darkness**,
  + temptations, weakness, depression
+ **Who** am I? Where does my **light** come from?

---
## (outline)
>>>
+ **Reality** of Chr's return
+ Remember in Chr we are sons of **light**
  + and sons of day
+ Push to **action** + life
+ "In Your **light** do we see light" (Ps36)
+ see **path** to walk, not **stumble**
  + nor meander **aimlessly**
+ no longer asleep but **awake**: 
  + 2nd **contrast** in v5

---
We are not of the night or of the darkness: 

[6](# "ref")
So then let us not sleep, as others do,  <br>
but let us keep awake and be sober. 

[1 Thesssalonians 5:5b-6 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **double** meaning of **sleep**:
  + 4:13 **died** in Chr, await resurr
  + **unaware**, unconscious
+ Fact we're not **destined** for wrath
+ does not mean we **passively** wait
  + for our salvation / reward
+ rather, bc Chr's **grace**
  + saving us beyond what we **deserve**
+ we are even more **motivated** by grat.
  + to live **worthily** of the calling:
  + Eph 4:

---
I ... urge you to walk in a manner <br>
worthy of the calling <br>
to which you have been called

[Ephesians 4:1 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Call to be **awake** + **sober**-minded
  + in light of imminence Chr return
+ Not **alarmist**: stoking **fear** / panic
  + quit job, live in commune in woods
  + fight to overthrow gov, devil
+ But **alert**, attentive to God's calling
  + not **autopilot** going through motions
+ Calling in Eph4: **love** e.o. in Chr
+ 3rd contrast v7: drunken -> **sober**

---
For those who sleep, sleep at night,  <br>
and those who get drunk, are drunk at night: 

[8](# "ref")
But since we belong to the day, let us be sober,  <br>
having put on the breastplate of faith and love,  <br>
and for a helmet the hope of salvation: 

[1 Thesssalonians 5:7-8 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ "sober": delib, not swept **passion**,
  + **focused**, not distracted:
+ e.g writing **dissertation**: clean house
  + "productive": busy
+ Fill day w/"necessary" chores
  + but neglect work God tasks us to do:
+ personal holiness as **faith** in action, 
  + responsib to debt of **love** to others,
  + duty/joy to share **hope** of salv w/world
+ **FHL** theme in 1Thes
+ Armor **protects** from Satan's schemes
  + **equips** to engage in God's work
+ God who **calls** us forward:

---
For God has not destined us for wrath,  <br>
but to obtain salvation through  <br>
our Lord Jesus Christ, <br>
[10](# "ref")
who died for us so that <br>
whether we are awake or asleep <br><br>
we might live with him. 

[1 Thesssalonians 5:9-10 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Chr won **victory** over sin + death
  + both **life** + death under His dominion
+ When we **die**, it's only **sleep**
  + in hope of **resurr**
  + to live w/Him forever
+ As long as we **live** on earth,
  + let it be in **wakefulness**
  + **focused** on the work God calls us to
  + so keeping **in step** w/Him
